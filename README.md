# Simple DOM Manipulation

This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript to style a `div` element dynamically. The project contains a simple HTML file and a JavaScript file that changes the appearance of a `div` by applying inline styles through JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that manipulates the DOM by applying styles to the `div` element.
